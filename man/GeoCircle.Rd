\arguments{
\item{id}{identifier for the object (URI)}

\item{geoRadius}{(Text or Number or Distance type.) Indicates the approximate radius of a GeoCircle (metres unless indicated otherwise via Distance notation).}

\item{geoMidpoint}{(GeoCoordinates type.) Indicates the GeoCoordinates at the centre of a GeoShape e.g. GeoCircle.}

\item{postalCode}{(Text or Text or Text type.) The postal code. For example, 94043.}

\item{polygon}{(Text type.) A polygon is the area enclosed by a point-to-point path for which the starting and ending points are the same. A polygon is expressed as a series of four or more space delimited points where the first and final points are identical.}

\item{line}{(Text type.) A line is a point-to-point path consisting of two or more points. A line is expressed as a series of two or more point objects separated by space.}

\item{elevation}{(Text or Number or Text or Number type.) The elevation of a location ([WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System)).}

\item{circle}{(Text type.) A circle is the circular region of a specified radius centered at a specified latitude and longitude. A circle is expressed as a pair followed by a radius in meters.}

\item{box}{(Text type.) A box is the area enclosed by the rectangle formed by two points. The first point is the lower corner, the second point is the upper corner. A box is expressed as two points separated by a space character.}

\item{addressCountry}{(Text or Country or Text or Country or Text or Country type.) The country. For example, USA. You can also provide the two-letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).}

\item{address}{(Text or PostalAddress or Text or PostalAddress or Text or PostalAddress or Text or PostalAddress or Text or PostalAddress type.) Physical address of the item.}

\item{url}{(URL type.) URL of the item.}

\item{sameAs}{(URL type.) URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.}

\item{potentialAction}{(Action type.) Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.}

\item{name}{(Text type.) The name of the item.}

\item{mainEntityOfPage}{(URL or CreativeWork type.) Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.}

\item{image}{(URL or ImageObject type.) An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].}

\item{identifier}{(URL or Text or PropertyValue type.) The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.}

\item{disambiguatingDescription}{(Text type.) A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.}

\item{description}{(Text type.) A description of the item.}

\item{alternateName}{(Text type.) An alias for the item.}

\item{additionalType}{(URL type.) An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.}

\description{
A GeoCircle is a GeoShape representing a circular geographic area. As it is a GeoShape          it provides the simple textual property 'circle', but also allows the combination of postalCode alongside geoRadius.          The center of the circle can be indicated via the 'geoMidpoint' property, or more approximately using 'address', 'postalCode'.
