\arguments{
\item{id}{identifier for the object (URI)}

\item{valueReference}{(StructuredValue or QuantitativeValue or QualitativeValue or PropertyValue or Enumeration or StructuredValue or QuantitativeValue or QualitativeValue or PropertyValue or Enumeration or StructuredValue or QuantitativeValue or QualitativeValue or PropertyValue or Enumeration type.) A pointer to a secondary value that provides additional information on the original value, e.g. a reference temperature.}

\item{nonEqual}{(QualitativeValue type.) This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is not equal to the object.}

\item{lesserOrEqual}{(QualitativeValue type.) This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than or equal to the object.}

\item{lesser}{(QualitativeValue type.) This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is lesser than the object.}

\item{greaterOrEqual}{(QualitativeValue type.) This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than or equal to the object.}

\item{greater}{(QualitativeValue type.) This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is greater than the object.}

\item{equal}{(QualitativeValue type.) This ordering relation for qualitative values indicates that the subject is equal to the object.}

\item{additionalProperty}{(PropertyValue or PropertyValue or PropertyValue or PropertyValue type.) A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.}

\item{url}{(URL type.) URL of the item.}

\item{sameAs}{(URL type.) URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.}

\item{potentialAction}{(Action type.) Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.}

\item{name}{(Text type.) The name of the item.}

\item{mainEntityOfPage}{(URL or CreativeWork type.) Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.}

\item{image}{(URL or ImageObject type.) An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].}

\item{identifier}{(URL or Text or PropertyValue type.) The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.}

\item{disambiguatingDescription}{(Text type.) A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.}

\item{description}{(Text type.) A description of the item.}

\item{alternateName}{(Text type.) An alias for the item.}

\item{additionalType}{(URL type.) An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.}
