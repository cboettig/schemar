#' BedDetails 
#'
#' An entity holding detailed information about the available bed types, e.g. the quantity of twin beds for a hotel room. For the single case of just one bed of a certain type, you can use bed directly with a text. See also [[BedType]] (under development). 
#'
#'
#' @param id identifier for the object (URI)
#' @param typeOfBed (Text type.) The type of bed to which the BedDetail refers, i.e. the type of bed available in the quantity indicated by quantity.
#' @param numberOfBeds (Number type.) The quantity of the given bed type available in the HotelRoom, Suite, House, or Apartment.
#' @param url (URL type.) URL of the item.
#' @param sameAs (URL type.) URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.
#' @param potentialAction (Action type.) Indicates a potential Action, which describes an idealized action in which this thing would play an 'object' role.
#' @param name (Text type.) The name of the item.
#' @param mainEntityOfPage (URL or CreativeWork type.) Indicates a page (or other CreativeWork) for which this thing is the main entity being described. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground) for details.
#' @param image (URL or ImageObject type.) An image of the item. This can be a [[URL]] or a fully described [[ImageObject]].
#' @param identifier (URL or Text or PropertyValue type.) The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of [[Thing]], such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See [background notes](/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg) for more details.
#' @param disambiguatingDescription (Text type.) A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
#' @param description (Text type.) A description of the item.
#' @param alternateName (Text type.) An alias for the item.
#' @param additionalType (URL type.) An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
